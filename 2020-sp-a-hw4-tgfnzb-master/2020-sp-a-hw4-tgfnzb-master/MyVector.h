// Purpose: Swaps two elements (including a vector).
// Parameters: a, b: the list elements themselves to be swapped
// Note: a and b can be any parameters, and just happen to be list this time.
// e.g., swap(list_obj[2], list_obj[1]);
// This one is similar to std::swap (you can check it's behavior).
// This is not a list function, but a general one, that swaps any elements, including array elements.
// On all assignments after this one, you can use std::swap (but not in this one).
// After this assignment (e.g., on pa05, you can use std::swap()
