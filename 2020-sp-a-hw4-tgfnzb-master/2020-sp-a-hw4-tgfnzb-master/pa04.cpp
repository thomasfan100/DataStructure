/* Sample main
 * Disclaimer: this file is not a unit test!
 * Just because it runs, does NOT mean your assignment is correct.
 * This file is for developing your own tests.
 * We've included vector below to show you how your types should behave.
 * You can use that for debugging.
 * When implementing your list, you are expected to use the same names and declarations as defined by the STL implementation of an array list, the vector.
 * The vector you implement must be templated on the data type it stores.

In main (or multiple mains) you should write your own "unit tests" for each function;
I suggest 1 main per function.

The sample input and output are defined in terms of the behavior of the std::vector (which you must test yourself).
