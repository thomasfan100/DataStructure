Programming assignment 3 (PA03)
==============================

# Recursive maze navigation

---

## What is this repository?
The files listed here are the starting point for your assignment.
Only add source files (not compiled files) to the Git repository.

## Assignment description
Help Niobe navigate through the matrix of service tunnels outside the matrix by creating a navigation system to find a path through this maze.
Your job is to write a program that finds, for every map, a path from wherever you are to the exit.
You can move in any of the four cardinal directions (North, East, West and South).
No diagonal moves are possible.
You must use recursive backtracking to solve the maze to get credit.
Cout each map with a path from the "Start" point to the "Exit".
Mark the path using a trail of the character '@'.
Follow the format as in the sample output.
Mazes may or may not have a solution, and there may be loops or islands in the maze, though all that are inputted will be valid enclosed mazes, and Niobe will always exist once in each maze.
There will be no "rooms", but only tunnels (1-wide gaps).
See the hints below! 'N' is Niobe, and 'E' is exit.

## Input/Output
These are both specified in the sample_*.txt files provided in your repository.

* Input is all via C++ std::cin. Even though sample_input.txt is a file, input is not via fstream or file input; we re-direct via **standard input**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams.
* The general form of input is here:
```
    <number of rows>
    <maze>
    <number of rows>
    <maze>
    0
```
Note: a row of 0 should terminate your program.

* sample_output.txt specifies exactly what your program should produce. We will use the Unix program **diff** to compare your output to this file, and if yours does not match, you will lose points.
* See pa01 for details as to how to use $diff at the command line.

## Grading
95% of this assignment will be graded based on the successful implementation of the functions in the header file using unit testing, and the correct output of main.
Each function's performance on its own unit test will be worth a certain subset of those points, and the output of main will as well.
A correct submission will result in a grade of 95%.
The remaining 5% will be awarded based on run-time for you main, with the student with the fastest run-time in the class receiving a 100%, and the slowest correct submission receiving 95%, and a linear interpolation (not sequential) using your actual time in between.

You **must** use recursion, and **no** you can't use a* until you take the AI course.

## Hint: Reading Lines with White-Space:

In this assignment, you are required to read lines with white spaces.

You might attempt to use something like:
```
    cin >> maze[i][j];
```
But that would NOT work well, since the extraction operator>> ignores white spaces.

Instead, read input with getline and std::string instead;
You may need to re-discover how to discard newlines to do this correctly; do so in main, not in fill_matrix.
I suggest reading the materials on strings here: http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/string/string/getline/

## Due date

# Peer review
After your results have been pushed, you will be added to another
student's repository (your reviewee), and another student to yours
(your reviewer).  Each student will be reviewing another student's
code, and each student's code will be reviewed, i.e. you will be both
a reviewee *and* a reviewer.

The reviewer's task is to review your assigned reviewee's code, and
leave feedback (by creating, writing, and committing a file named
*review.txt* to *their reviewee's* repo) that includes (but is not
limited to) feedback regarding the following areas:

   - *Style: *Is the code style consistent, readable? Does it include
   adequate whitespace or too much whitespace? How well does your
   reviewee's code adhere to the Computer Science department's C++
   coding standard? The standard is available here
   <http://web.mst.edu/~cpp/cpp_coding_standard_v1_1.pdf>.

   - *Documentation: *Is the code documented in a way that makes the data
   structure's implementation easy to understand? How could the documentation
   be improved?

   - *Readability/structure: *Is the data structure implemented in a way
   that makes sense? Could the code be refactored to make it more robust or
   logical?

   - *Correctness: *Does the code implement the data structures and
   algorithms properly? If not, how could it be fixed?

   - *Efficiency: *Does the code have efficiency of coding (few lines), and
   of computation (computational efficiency)?

The reviewee's task is to use this feedback to improve their code, and
thus their score on the assignment. Additionally, each student is
responsible for committing a file named *quality.txt *to *their own*
repository that contains an integer (0-100) on the first line of the
file that represents the quality of the feedback they received from
the reviewer, considering the following criteria:

   - *Constructivity: *Did the feedback you received contain direct
   suggestions about how your code could be improved? Were these suggestions
   relevant and helpful?

   - *Justification: *Did the reviewer's suggestions include explan=
ations r
   egarding *why* your code should be changed?

   - *Tone: *Was the feedback kind and professional? Was the criticism you
   received constructive (as opposed to destructive)?

   - *Clarity: *Was it easy to read, with good grammar, style, and
   structure of presented ideas?

Leaving honest and constructive feedback benefits both the reviewer and
the reviewee. As such, your final grade on this assignment will be a
function of your regraded assignment, your original score, and the
quality of your feedback as evaluated by your reviewee.

Your reviews and grades of review will be due at a date specified on the calendar
